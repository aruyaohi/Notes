Bash: Bourne Again Shell


What is Bash?

A shell is a user interface for ease of use. Making easier of the user to manage the operating system, without knowing of all the inner workings and complexity of the Operating system

# Basic Commands:
a. echo --Text--: To display text passed. E.g echo Hello => Hello.
b. cat: This displays the content of a file. Note: But in order to read a file we ought to create a file and so we did using "VIM"
    so we type: vim textfile.txt:
        a. followed by clicking on "i" to insert text to file. after i is clicked text is then entered.
        b. after typing, the esc key is clicked. 
        c. followed by :w to write and update text. 
        d. to exit we then type :q.

    -- and that's that for creating a file --
    n:b we could write :q to make life easier. such that the file is writen and vim is exited

    Now we move on to using the cat command to print the content of the file.
    command: cat textfile.txt


=> Step 2 ( we call it a night after this): we create a shell using the knowledge we've gathered so far
a. first we open vim: vim shelltest.sh

b. we then write shell script : echo hello world!
c. we write and exit vim using:  :wq
d. then we run shell with the bash command. => bash shelltest.sh
e. code ran sucessfully
