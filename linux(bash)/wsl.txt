What is WSL?

This is short for the Windows Subsystem for Linux. 

What is it's function?
The function of WSL is to access linux specific applications, tools and to test compatibility ( with the linux OS of course) without the need of installing linux via a virtual box ( which is quite tedious and consumes more space and processing).

From it's function it can be deduced that this particular applicaition was designed for programmers who'd like to build applications that are to run on th linux OS
on windows. so i can build linux applicaitions on windows and test to see if they'd run smoothly.


** Fortunately for me i had installed wsl some months back for a rust project and ubuntu as the linux distro. but i have forgotten the password **

so in order to regain the password, these where the steps i took:
a. wsl -l -v: To get the label(name) of linux distro and the version
b. wsl -d Ubuntu -u root: launch wsl as root to bypass password.
c. passwd user_name: in this case ruyatech. and then an input appears to enter and reenter password. password has then been offically reset


=> After password reset, i proceeded to update and upgrade linux distro(ubuntu).

Next step would involve me learning bash.
