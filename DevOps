DevOps:

Roadmaps(by Most: one year ago): 
a. learn to use linux. for starters bash (Most advices i spend about 3-weeks working on this. 
b. Networking concepts: Mosh recommends wireshark and dedicating the next 2-weeks to that.
c. Programming languages ( such as Python, R and Go). Most recommends Python with 4 weeks but i'll be reducing mine to 2 weeks as i have prior knowledge.
d. Cloud Providers ( such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platforms). Mosh recommends AWS (4 to six weeks).
e. Containerization ( docker) 4 weeks.
f. Continous Integration / Deployment or CI/CD. Most recomends (Jenkins as tool to learn) 4 weeks.
g. Orchestration and Management (kubenetes). 4-six weeks.
h. Networking and Infrastructure Services. 
i. Configuration Management. 3-4weeks
j. Infrastructure as code or Iac. (Terraform) 3-4 weeks
k. Monitoring and Logging (prometheus) 3-4 weeks

estimated Duration: 10-14 months


Terminal Knowledge:
a. Process Monitoring: Process Monitoring is the continous observation and analysis of IT processes within an IT organisation to ensure optimal performance, efficiency and compliance.
It involves tracking key metrics, resource utilization and behaviour of individual processes or applications running on a system.


Process Monitoring involves tools that provide real-time data on CPU Usage, Memory Consumption, I/O Operations and thread activity. Often include features such as:
a. Alerting
b. logging
c. visualisation of process data.
