DevOps:
Roadmaps(by Most: one year ago): 
a. learn to use linux. for starters bash (Most advices i spend about 3-weeks working on this. 
  * File system: ls, cp,mv,rm
  * Permissions: chmod,chown
  * Processes: ps, top, Kill
  * Packages: apt, yum

b. Networking concepts: Mosh recommends wireshark and dedicating the next 2-weeks to that.
  * OSI and TCP/IP models: ls, cp,mv,rm
  * Ip addressing and subnetting
  * DNS and DHCP
  * HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and SSH
  * Firewalls and Security Groups
  * Ping, traceroute, and netstat ( for some network troubleshooting)

c. GIT:
  * Clone, Commit, Push, and Pull
  * Branching and Merging
  * Resolving and merge conflicts
  * Working with remote repositories

d. Programming languages ( such as Python, R and Go). Most recommends Python with 4 weeks but i'll be reducing mine to 2 weeks as i have prior knowledge.
  (Sticking with python, already have some experience with it).
  * Python syntax and data structures.
  * Modules and Packages
  * Write and execute python scripts
  * Work with files
  * Handle erros 
  * write automation scripts.

e. Cloud Providers ( such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platforms). Mosh recommends AWS (4 to six weeks).
  * Launch, configure and manage virtual servers
  * Store  manage data
  * Manage users, groups, and roles
  * Setup and manage isolated networks

f. Containerization ( docker) 4 weeks.
  * create Docker images
  * Starting, Stopping and managing  Containers
  * Write DockerFiles
  * Run Multi-container apps using Docker Compose.

g. Continous Integration / Deployment or CI/CD. Most recomends (Jenkins as tool to learn) 4 weeks.
  * Create and Manage Jenkins Pipelines
  * Write Jenkins Files
  * Integrate Automated tests.
  * Automate the build process
  * Automate the Deployment

h. Orchestration and Management (kubenetes). 4-six weeks.
  * Overall Architecture
  * Key Components
  * Manage Resources
  * Scale Applications
  * Networking Models

i. Networking and Infrastructure Services. 
  * Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy
  * configure it to act as  a forward proxy
  * Caching Stratedgies

j. Configuration Management. 3-4weeks
  * Write Ansible Playbooks
k. Infrastructure as code or Iac. (Terraform) 3-4 weeks
l. Monitoring and Logging (prometheus) 3-4 weeks


Tracking or Progress ( Steps completed so far):
--------- None so far -------------

Estimated Duration: 10-14 months


Terminal Knowledge:
a. Process Monitoring: Process Monitoring is the continous observation and analysis of IT processes within an IT organisation to ensure optimal performance, efficiency and compliance.
It involves tracking key metrics, resource utilization and behaviour of individual processes or applications running on a system.


Process Monitoring involves tools that provide real-time data on CPU Usage, Memory Consumption, I/O Operations and thread activity. Often include features such as:
a. Alerting
b. logging
c. visualisation of process data.
